scanned heather cultivar catalogue of my late father, Herman Blum

My father, Herman Blum, from Steenwijkerwold, the Netherlands, passed away in 2003.
In his professional life, he was a garneder with a passion for heather plants. He turned into one of Europe's biggest specialists in heather cultivars.

He kept a paper archive with all cultivars, which I scanned and am making public here.
these are in dutch. Should you need translation, reach out to me.
